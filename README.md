# Meta_Learning_Environmental_Sounds
Here we have performed meta learning on environmental sounds, available in the ESC-10 and ESC-50 datasets, to check how these algorithms perform on different scenarios, rather than the traditional testing done on images, tabulated the results for different n-way and k-shot settings, helpful for further research in this field.
The general trend observed and results are:
Training accuracy found to be very good, around 98-99.5%
Testing accuracy was highest as expected for higher shots.

All the corresponding code files and test results are uploaded in this repository.
